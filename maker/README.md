This repository is a Liquidity Module for the Hydro SDK.

Liquidity Modules allow relayers to instantly fill their orderbooks and bootstrap liquidity with minimal effort. This particular module uses a [Constant Product Market Making Model](https://github.com/HydroProtocol/amm-bots#constant-product-amm), discussed in greater detail below.

#### Using this repository

This repository is a subset of https://github.com/HydroProtocol/hydro-scaffold-dex. It is designed to start a market making bot to provide liquidity on an existing Hydro Relayer.

# AMM Bots

Automated Market Making (AMM) bots provide liquidity to a marketplace through use of algorithmic market making.

## Running the AMM Bot

This repository is setup to run naturally on the [Hydro Dex Scaffold](https://github.com/HydroProtocol/hydro-scaffold-dex). For use on other marketplaces, you could modify the code snippets below.

### Running from source

```
BOT_TYPE=CONST_PRODUCT \
BOT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x............... \
BOT_BASE_TOKEN=HOT \
BOT_QUOTE_TOKEN=DAI \
BOT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001 \
BOT_MIN_PRICE=0.8 \
BOT_MAX_PRICE=1.2 \
BOT_PRICE_GAP=0.02 \
BOT_EXPAND_INVENTORY=2 \
BOT_WEB3_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
go run main.go
```

### Running from a docker image

```
docker run --rm -it \
  -e BOT_TYPE=CONST_PRODUCT \
  -e BOT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x............... \
  -e BOT_BASE_TOKEN=HOT \
  -e BOT_QUOTE_TOKEN=DAI \
  -e BOT_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001 \
  -e BOT_MIN_PRICE=0.8 \
  -e BOT_MAX_PRICE=1.2 \
  -e BOT_PRICE_GAP=0.02 \
  -e BOT_EXPAND_INVENTORY=2 \
  -e BOT_WEB3_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  hydroprotocolio/amm-bots
```

## Environment Variables

### Basic Variables
 - `BOT_TYPE` Type of bot
 - `BOT_BASE_URL` Hydro relayer api base url
 - `BOT_WEB3_URL` Ethereum json rpc url 
 - `BOT_BASE_TOKEN` Symbol of base token *(e.g HOT)*
 - `BOT_QUOTE_TOKEN` Symbol of quote token *(e.g WETH)*
 
### Secret Variables

 - `BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` Ethereum address for place order

## Algorithm Variables

### Constant Product AMM

This bot runs a "constant product market maker model" (popularized in the DeFi community by Uniswap). In short, this model generates a full orderbook based on an initial price for the market. Every transaction that occurs on this market will adjust the prices of the market accordingly. It's a basic supply and demand automated market making system.

- Buying large amounts of the base token will increase the price
- Selling large amounts of the base token will decrease the price

A typical Constant Market Making model has a continuous price curve. This bot discretizes the continuous price curve and creates a number of limit orders to simulate the curve. The order price is limited between `BOT_MAX_PRICE` and `BOT_MIN_PRICE`. The price difference between adjacent orders is `BOT_PRICE_GAP`.

Constant product algorithms have a disadvantage of low inventory utilization. For example, by default it only uses 5% of your inventory when the price increases 10%. `BOT_EXPAND_INVENTORY` can help you add depth near the current price.

 - `BOT_MAX_PRICE` Max order price
 - `BOT_MIN_PRICE` Min order price
 - `BOT_PRICE_GAP` Price difference rate between adjacent orders. For example, ask price increases by 2% and bid price decreases by 2% if `BOT_PRICE_GAP=0.02`.
 - `BOT_EXPAND_INVENTORY` Multiply your order sizes linearly. For example, all order sizes will be tripled if `BOT_EXPAND_INVENTORY=3`.

#### Liquidity Sourcing In Constant Product AMM

Constant Product AMM requires a single source of funds for both the base and quote token. As such, the general flow of setting up the AMM bot from scratch is:

- Prepare an address that holds both the BASE and QUOTE token of the trading pair you want to provide liquidity for
- Set the initial parameters for the bot
  - This determines the initial price, spread, sensitivity, etc.
- Run the bot

Upon running the bot, it will generate an orderbook for your marketplace. The orderbook will appear to be static, but every trade will shift the market accordingly.
